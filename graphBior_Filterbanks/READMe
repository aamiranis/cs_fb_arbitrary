GraphBior-toolbox: Graph Biorthogonal Wavelet Filterbank toolbox
(c) Sunil K Narang, 2012

Primary Author : Sunil K Narang (kumarsun@usc.edu)

This toolbox contains code implementing the graphBior Wavelet
Filterbanks, a general framework for 
defining wavelet filterbanks for
data defined on vertices of a weighted graph. The algorithms
implemented here are described in detail in 

"Compact Support Biorthogonal Wavelet Filterbanks for Arbitrary Undirected Graphs", 
S. K. Narang and Antonio Ortega, 
Tech. Rep. arXiv:1210.8129, Nov 2012,

No extra toolboxes are required to be installed. Matalab wavelet toolbox is NOT required. 
The codes include a sgwt_toolbox from http://wiki.epfl.ch/sgwt.


Installation of the files is simple, simply unpack the directory. 

Then, run the demos

>> Biorth_filterbank_demo1
>> Biorth_filterbank_demo2
and
>> Biorth_filterbank_demo3

See the source codes for additional options.
