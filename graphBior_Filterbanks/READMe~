Graph-QMF-toolbox: Graph Quadrature Mirror Filterbank toolbox
(c) Sunil K Narang, 2011

Primary Author : Sunil K Narang (kumarsun@usc.edu)

This toolbox contains code implementing the graph-QMF Wavelet
Filterbanks, a general framework for 
defining wavelet filterbanks for
data defined on vertices of a weighted graph. The algorithms
implemented here are described in detail in 

"Perfect Reconstruction Two-Channel Wavelet Filter-Banks For Graph Structured Data", 
S. K. Narang and Antonio Ortega, 
Tech. Rep. arXiv:1106.3693v2, June 2011,

Before you uunpack the files: you need to install additional toolboxes on your computer.
These are following:
1. SGWT_toolbox by David Hammond. Link: http://wiki.epfl.ch/sgwt
2. Graph-Viz Software. Link: http://www.graphviz.org/
3. Matlab plugin toolbox for Graph-Viz. Link : http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4518-matlab-graphviz-interface


Installation of the files is simple, simply unpack the directory. 

Then, run the demo
